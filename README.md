## 👋 Hi, I’m Ramin Bagheri

**AI & ML Engineer | LLMs | Agent Systems | Real-World AI Implementation**

I am an AI & Machine Learning Engineer focused on **designing, engineering, and deploying production-ready AI systems**. My work centers on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **agentic architectures**, and **end-to-end ML pipelines** that move beyond experimentation into real-world usage.

I’m particularly interested in building **reliable, scalable, and explainable AI systems** that integrate cleanly with modern software stacks.

* **Agent Systems**

  * Multi-agent orchestration
  * Workflow-driven agents for automation and decision support
  * Agent reliability, memory, and control flow

* **Machine Learning Engineering**

  * Model training, evaluation, and deployment
  * Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  * Production ML pipelines

* **Applied AI**

  * AI systems for real-world business and engineering problems
  * Bridging research concepts with practical implementation

If you want, next I can:

1. Rewrite this in a **more senior / architect tone**
2. Make a **shorter, punchier version**
3. Customize it for **job-seeking vs open-source visibility**
4. Align it tightly with **LLM/Agent-specific roles**

Just tell me which direction you want.
